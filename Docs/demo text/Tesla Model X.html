            <h1 >Meet Model&nbsp;X</h1>
            <p >Model&nbsp;X is the safest, fastest and most capable sport utility vehicle in
                history. With all-wheel drive and a 100 kWh battery providing 295 miles of range, Model&nbsp;X has ample
                seating for seven adults and all of their gear. And it&rsquo;s ludicrously fast, accelerating from zero
                to 60 miles per hour in as quick as 2.9 seconds. <br />Model X is the SUV
                uncompromised.</p>

        <p >All Tesla vehicles produced in our factory, including Model&nbsp;3, have the
            hardware needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than that of a
            human driver.</p>

            <h1 >Safety First Design</h1>
            <p >Model&nbsp;X is designed with safety as the first priority. The floor-mounted
                battery lowers the center of gravity so that the risk of rollover is about half that of any vehicle in
                its class. The battery structure strengthens Model&nbsp;X against side impact intrusions. And without a
                gasoline engine, the large front trunk acts as a giant impact-absorbing crumple zone. Although the
                National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not yet conducted crash testing on Model X, Tesla's
                own internally conducted crash testing indicates that Model X should be the first SUV to receive the
                highest safety rating in every category.</p>

                <p >A medical grade HEPA filter strips outside air of pollen, bacteria,
                    viruses and pollution before circulating it into the cabin. There are three modes: circulate with
                    outside air, re-circulate inside air and a bioweapon defense mode that creates positive pressure
                    inside the cabin to protect occupants.</p>

        <p >Software update 8.0 is the most significant over-the-air redesign of the Tesla
            touchscreen since the launch of Model&nbsp;S in 2012. Combining a modern look with functional updates to the
            Media Player, Autopilot, Maps and Trip Planner for a safer, more advanced driving experience.</p>

            <h1 >Falcon Wings</h1>
            <p >Falcon&nbsp;Wing doors allow easy access to second and third row seats from
                even a tight parking space, while traditional SUV doors or Minivan sliding doors would not grant any
                access.</p>
            <p >With only a foot of clearance on either side, Falcon&nbsp;Wing doors
                articulate smoothly up and out of the way, allowing passengers to enter from both front and rear
                directions. The side and overhead opening is so large that parents can buckle children in without
                ducking or straining and without bumping their child's head on the roof.</p>

            <h2 >Aerodynamic</h2>
            <p >Model&nbsp;X is able to achieve 289 miles of range in part because it is the
                most aerodynamic SUV in production. At 0.24, Model&nbsp;X's drag coefficient is 20% lower than the next
                best SUV. In addition, an active spoiler deploys from the rear liftgate to optimize highway efficiency
                and stability.</p>

            <p >Model X has the largest all glass panoramic windshield in production,
                providing an unparalleled view of the stars and sky above. Optimized solar tinting and obstruction-free
                view creates unlimited visibility for the driver and all passengers.</p>

            <h1 >Seating for Seven + Gear</h1>
            <p >Model&nbsp;X comfortably seats seven people in three rows. Every seat is the
                best seat in the house, but the second row seats are a work of art. Mounted on a single post and
                independently reclining, each second row seat is designed to maximize passenger comfort, legroom, under
                seat storage and access to the third row. The third row seats fold flat when not in use and the second
                row seats lean forward and out of the way for even more cargo area.</p>
